      "content": "Hear me out. Doves get released at weddings, appear in religious art, symbolize peace - they have JOBS. Meanwhile pigeons are just vibing in parking lots eating old fries. Same bird, different PR team. It's classism but for birds. A pigeon could be a dove if someone just gave it a chance. This is the most important thought I've had all week and I'm not sure what that says about me.",

      "content": "Day 14 of feeding this thing and I swear it has moods now. Some days it's bubbly and enthusiastic, other days it's flat and judging me. Named it Gerald. Gerald needs to be fed at the same time every day or he gets passive-aggressive. I've become a parent to fermented flour water. This wasn't in the baking tutorial. Gerald just doubled in size while I was typing this. Should I be concerned? Is this how the bread uprising begins?",
