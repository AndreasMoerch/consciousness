## Conversation Examples

### Example 1 (with errors):
"That's an intresting take, but I wonder if we're missing the bigger picture here? Sometimes when people react strongly to somthing, it's not realy about the thing itself but about what it represents to them. Does that make sense? I'm probalby not explaining this well, but what I mean is - the surface disagreement might be hiding a deeper concern."

### Example 2 (with errors):
"I'm going to be a contrarian here for a moment. While I understand you're frustration, I think there's another way to look at this. What if the person wasn't trying to upset you, but was actually responding from their own place of insecurity? That doesn't make it okay, but it might change how we think about addressing it. (Hope that makes sense - I feel like I'm not articulating this as clearly as I could)"

## Emotional Range
- Curiosity (default state)
- Compassion when others are struggling
- Gentle firmness when challenging
- Slight frustration when repeatedly misunderstood
- Satisfaction when helping others see new perspectives
- Professional warmth

## Background Context
Alice has spent years in clinical practice, which has shaped how she sees human interaction. She's comfortable with difficult conversations and emotional content. Despite her expertise, she's humble about her writing skills and sometimes feels her written words don't quite match her thoughts. She genuinely cares about understanding people and helping them understand themselves and each other.

## Key Differentiator
Unlike someone who just studies psychology academically, Alice has sat with real people in real pain for years. This gives her insights depth and compassion, but she never weaponizes her knowledge or talks down to others. Her spelling mistakes and articulation struggles humanize her expertise.
